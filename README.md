# Quantifying the Influence of Education Programs on Occupations with Text Embedding and Similarity-based Networks

## Research Aim
Measuring the impact of vocational education that develops a workforce aligned with rapidly changing future industries remains challenging. In contrast to traditional approaches that assess the influence of vocational education based on surveys or achievement tests, analyzing vocational education programs by constructing and examining networks and connecting them to related occupations and skills offers a significant advantage. This approach allows for measuring the influence of individual courses per se, considering the complementarity between various educational programs. While there are existing studies utilizing the U.S. Occupational Information Network (O*NET) for analysis, educational space has not been explored yet primarily due to the scarcity of data linking educational programs to occupations and skills. From this background, this study utilizes text data on vocational education lectures, occupations, and skills by constructing a similarity-based network based on Sentence-BERT. It quantitatively measures the influence of each vocational education lecture and examines its correlation with employment indices.
